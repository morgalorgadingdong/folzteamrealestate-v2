The lifespan of engineered wood flooring can be shortened if it is exposed to moisture or high humidity, as the layers of the flooring can start to delaminate. With that being said, it is worth noting that the lifespan of both solid hardwood and engineered wood flooring can also be impacted by factors such as the quality of the product, the level of foot traffic, and the level of care and maintenance provided.`
