Using a neutral color palate will also make it easier for you to update the space and change the decor as needed. It will also be more appealing to a wider range of guests as it will not be as opinionated as a bold color scheme. This way your guests will feel more comfortable, and it will be easier to keep the property looking clean and well-maintained.`

Hardwood floors can last for decades or even centuries with proper maintenance and care, while engineered wood flooring has a lifespan of around 20-30 years. The lifespan of engineered wood flooring can be shortened if it is exposed to moisture or high humidity, as the layers of the flooring can start to delaminate. With that being said, it is worth noting that the lifespan of both solid hardwood and engineered wood flooring can also be impacted by factors such as the quality of the product, the level of foot traffic, and the level of care and maintenance provided.`

While engineered wood flooring is generally less expensive than solid hardwood flooring, the cost can vary depending on the type of wood and the quality of the flooring. In general, solid hardwood flooring is more expensive than engineered wood flooring, but it may be worth the investment for homeowners who are looking for a long-lasting flooring option. In general, solid hardwood flooring can cost anywhere between $5 to $15 per square foot while engineered wood flooring can cost between $3 to $10 per square foot, depending on the quality and finish.`
